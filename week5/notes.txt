Notes for lecture 5 - section data structures

When to use a certain type of data structure:

Scenario 1:
You work for a company that has created a digital assistant with
its wake word. Sometimes the assistant doesn't hear the wake word correctly.
Your job is to ensure the voice assistant can be awoken with a greater variety of words.

When choosing for the correct type of data structure we need to consider the following:
- Deletion
- Insertion
- Searching

To create a node in C:
                                                                struct node {
                                                                    string phrase;
                                                                    struct node *next;
                                                                }
                                                                node;

Define node, inside of it we have phrase and a pointer to the struct node.
This work for now for phrases but it's for example sakes.

Now create a node that is a pointer to the struct node:
                                                                node *list = NULL;
                                                                node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));

The node *n is now pointing to some space for a node in memory.

Now we need to add the phrase to the node:
                                                                n->phrase = "hello";       

We are declaring that "hello" is the phrase in the node.
After that we need to add the node to the list:
                                                                n->next = NULL;
                                                                list = n;

Now we have a list with one node in it.

Now we add another node to the list:
                                                                node *n2 = malloc(sizeof(node));
                                                                n2->phrase = "hi";
                                                                n2->next = list;
                                                                list = n2;
